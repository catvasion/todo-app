# Simple Todo App
This is a simple command-line Todo App developed in Python. It allows you to add, show, edit, and remove items from your Todo list.

## Getting Started
1.Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2.Clone this repository or copy the code from the app.py file.

## Usage
Run the Python script to start the Todo App.

The app will prompt you to type add, show, edit, remove, or exit:

- Type  ```add``` to add a new item to your Todo list.
- Type ```show``` to display all the items in your Todo list.
- Type ```edit``` to edit an existing item in your Todo list.
- Type ```remove``` to remove an item from your Todo list.
- Type ```exit``` to exit the app.

## Data Persistence
Your Todo list is stored in the files/todos.txt file. Make sure this file exists before running the app. The app will automatically create the file if it does not exist.
